Mastering these basic Ubuntu commands will ultimately boost your productivity and enhance your ability to manage your system effectively.

---

## üéØ**Scope** 
Applicable for users managing Ubuntu systems for personal, development, or server-related tasks. 
It includes commands for file operations, directory management, user permissions, process monitoring, and more.

---

## ‚úÖ**Prerequisites** 
- Access to a terminal on an Ubuntu system.
- Appropriate permissions for commands requiring `sudo`.

## üõ†Ô∏è**Commands** 

### **1. Basic System Commands**
1. **Check Ubuntu Version**
   ```bash
   lsb_release -a
   ```
   Displays details about the current Ubuntu version.

2. **View Kernel Version**
   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```
   Displays the Linux kernel version.

3. **Update and Upgrade Packages**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```
   Updates package lists and installs available updates.

4. **Reboot System**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
    Safely restarts the system, ensuring all running processes are terminated properly.

---

### **2. File Commands**
1. **Create an Empty File**
   ```bash
   touch filename
   ```
   The `touch` command creates a new, empty file named filename or updates the timestamp if the file already exists.

2. **View File Content**
   ```bash
   cat filename
   ```
   The `cat` command displays the contents of a file, allows concatenation of multiple files, or can be used to create and append content to files.

3. **Delete a File**
   ```bash
   rm filename
   ```
   The `rm filename` command deletes the specified file (filename) permanently from the filesystem.

4. **Rename or Move a File**
   ```bash
   mv old_filename new_filename
   ```

5. **Copying to a Same Directory**
   ```bash
   cp file1.txt file2.txt
   ```
   The `cp file1.txt file2.txt` command copies the contents of file1.txt to a new file named file2.txt. If file2.txt doesn't exist, it will be created.

6. **Copying to a Different Directory:**
   ```bash
   cp file.txt Path_of_the_directory
   ```
   The `cp file.txt Path_of_the_directory` command copies the file file.txt into the specified directory `(Path_of_the_directory)`.

---

### **3. Directory Commands**
1. **Create a New Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir directory_name
   ```
   The `mkdir directory_name` command creates a new, empty directory named `directory_name` in the current working directory.

2. **Remove an Empty Directory**
   ```bash
   rmdir directory_name
   ```
   The `rmdir directory_name` command removes an empty directory named `directory_name`. It only works if the directory is empty.

3. **Delete a Directory with Files**
   ```bash
   rm -r directory_name
   ```
   The `rm -r` directory_name command recursively removes a directory `(directory_name)` and all of its contents, including subdirectories and files.

4. **List Contents of a Directory**
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
   Displays files, directories, and permissions in detailed format.

---

### **4. File Permission Commands**
1. **View File Permissions**
   ```bash
   ls -l filename
   ```
   The `ls -l` filename command displays detailed information about the specified file (filename), including its permissions, owner, group, size, and the last modification date.

2. **Change File Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 755 filename
   ```
   The `chmod 755 filename` command sets the file permissions of filename to rwxr-xr-x, which means:

* The owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
* The group and others have read and execute permissions.

3. **Change Ownership of a File**
   ```bash
   sudo chown user:group filename
   ```
   The `sudo chown user:group filename` command changes the ownership of a specified file (filename), setting the user as user and the group as group.

4. **Add Write Permission for All Users**
   ```bash
   chmod a+w filename
   ```
   The `chmod a+w filename` command adds write permissions for all users (owner, group, and others) on the specified file `(filename)`.

---

### **5. Process Management Commands**
1. **List Running Processes**
   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```
   The `ps aux` command displays detailed information about all running processes on the system, including their user, CPU/memory usage, and other statistics.

2. **Kill a Process**
   ```bash
   kill PID
   ```
   Replaces `PID` with the Process ID.

3. **Force Kill a Process**
   ```bash
   kill -9 PID
   ```
   The `kill -9` command forcefully terminates a process by sending it the SIGKILL signal, ensuring it stops immediately.

4. **Monitor System Processes**
   ```bash
   top
   ```
   The `top` command provides a real-time, dynamic view of system processes, including CPU, memory usage, and running tasks.

5. **Search for a Specific Process**
   ```bash
   pgrep process_name
   ```
   The `pgrep process_name` command searches for processes by name and returns their process IDs (PIDs).

6. **Check Resource Usage by Process**
   ```bash
   htop
   ```
   The `htop` command is an interactive, user-friendly process viewer that displays system resource usage and allows you to manage processes in real time.

---

### **6. Network Commands**
1. **Ping a Server**
   ```bash
   ping example.com
   ```
   The `ping` command tests the network connectivity between your system and a specified host by sending ICMP echo requests and measuring response times.

2. **Check Open Ports**
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tuln
   ```
   The `sudo netstat -tuln` command displays active TCP and UDP network connections, along with their listening ports, in a numeric format, requiring root privileges for complete information.

3. **Traceroute**
   ```bash
   traceroute example.com
   ```
   The `traceroute` command is used to trace the route that packets take from your computer to a specified destination, showing the sequence of routers (hops) the packets pass through along with the time taken for each hop.

---

### **7. Disk Management**
1. **Check Disk Usage**
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
   The `df -h` command displays the disk space usage of all mounted filesystems in a human-readable format, showing sizes in KB, MB, or GB.

2. **View Free Memory**
   ```bash
   free -h
   ```
   The `free -h` command displays the system's memory usage, including total, used, free, and available memory, in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB).

3. **List Partitions**
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   The `lsblk` command lists all block devices (such as hard drives, partitions, and USB drives) on your system, showing their names, sizes, and mount points.

---

## üìù**Notes** 
- Always double-check commands involving `sudo` to avoid unintentional changes.
- Refer to the `man` command (e.g., `man ls`) for detailed usage instructions.
- For troubleshooting, consult the [Ubuntu Documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/).
